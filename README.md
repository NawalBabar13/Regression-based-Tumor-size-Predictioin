# Regression-based-Tumor-size-Predictioin
This project aims to develop a regression-based predictive model to estimate tumor size non-invasively using patient data.  By leveraging machine learning regression techniques, this model provides a less invasive alternative to traditional tumor measurement methods, potentially improving patient comfort and clinical outcomes.
