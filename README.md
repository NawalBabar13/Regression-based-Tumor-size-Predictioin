# Regression-based-Tumor-size-Predictioin
This project aims to develop a regression-based predictive model to estimate tumor size non-invasively using patient data.  By leveraging machine learning regression techniques, this model provides a less invasive alternative to traditional tumor measurement methods, potentially improving patient comfort and clinical outcomes.
Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Implementation of multiple regression algorithms
Model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² score
Comparison of regression models to select the best-performing one
Visualization of predicted vs actual tumor sizes
Discussion of limitations and potential future improvements
Technologies Used

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Usage

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/regression-tumor-size-prediction.git
Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script to train and evaluate models:
python main.py
Dataset

The dataset includes patient clinical and imaging features relevant for tumor size prediction. (Provide dataset source or instructions if applicable.)

Results

Best model achieved an R² score of X.XX (example)
Visualizations demonstrate the accuracy of predictions
Limitations

Dataset size and diversity may affect generalizability
Further validation needed with external datasets
Potential improvements include feature engineering and advanced regression techniques
Future Work

Incorporate deep learning models
Use multi-modal data inputs (e.g., imaging, genomics)
Deploy as a clinical decision support tool
